A classical music recommendation app applying machine learning (IN PROGRESS).

OpusML leverages machine learning with Weka to classify classical music tracks into mood categories such as Calm, Energetic, Melancholic, and Joyful based on their audio features fetched from Spotify.
We are currently training a Random Forrest classifier to predict the mood of pieces.
